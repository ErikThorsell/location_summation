# Usage

Add the addresses of interest to the dictionary in the script and run:

```
python location_summation.py <API-KEY>
```

# Example

In its current state, the script checks whether to meet up at the Swedish King,
the Prime Minister, the Feminist Initiative's office or the Christian Democrats'
office.

As of the evening of creating the script, the last option is the best, as the
result of running the script is:

```
Best place to be is at: Ebba
Total driving time is: 40 minutes

Host: Ebba, Time: 40 minutes
Host: Steffe, Time: 44 minutes
